# Cellolution

Watch a simulated evolution of cells and organisms in a GUI showing an artificial ocean.

**What is Cellolution? It's a m√©lange of a game, a simulation, a screensaver and an evolutionary process in its own small universe: the Ocean.**

Within this ocean there are different kinds of single cells and more complex organisms (complex evolving organisms are under construction, some smaller ones available within the next days or weeks).

The ocean has dissolved materials as well as energy (beams of sunlight, organic matter, H2S hydrogen sulfide, and others) to let to organisms grow, starve or die. If the energy and material of an organism reaches a certain level, it splits itself into two of them - sometimes with an evolutionary transformation to another type of species.

**Interested? Look at these examples:**

"Black Smokers"  exists on the ground of the ocean emitting H2S and sometimes H2S consuming cells.

<br/>"Algae Cells" like CO2 and sunlight as energy source, therefore live usually close to the surface.

<br/>If an organism has accumulated enough energy (and some substances), it may split up into two organisms - sometimes with an evolutionary transformation.

Cells may also starve (color: dark red), lacking of energy and/or substances. If starvation continues, the cell will die. Dead cells (black) are sinking to the ground and their matter disintegrates within the ocean again - until they vanish.

###How to run it:
Download the newest Github release **cellolutionVxxx.jar** file into a new directory (suggestion: "Cellolution") cause it will save its state in a JSON file and call it from the command line within this directory using

**java -jar cellolutionVxxx.jar**

where **xxx** is the current version. You need a Java runtime/JDK installed (**Linux**: simply use your package manager, **Windows/macOS/others**: download and install JDK from [here](https://openjdk.java.net/)).<br/> 


You may also build it from scratch using Ant and the build.xml file.<br/>

**Apache 2.0 licensed**.<br/>
